# ðŸ““ NanoBlog

<https://blog.mynano.ninja>

A blog system using the Nano cryptocurrency and IPFS.

## Description

It shows the potential of data storage on the Nano blockchain with linkage to a different decentralized storage.
As Nano is not designed to store large amounts of data you need a second level solution to store any data that is larger than a few bytes.
The dencentralized solution is to use the representative field to store the IPFS hash.
